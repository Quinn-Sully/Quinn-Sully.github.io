    <h1>The best website by Quinn Sullivan</h1>
    <h2>This website is simply the best website.</h2>
    <h2>Let me tell you why.</h2>
    <strong>Firstly, look at that URL.</strong>
    <p>You couldn't convince me that that isn't the greatest URL ever.</p>
    <p>I mean look at it, a hyphen before the first period? And it isn't even a .com? Wow.</p>
    <h2>But that isn't all, here are even more reasons as to why this website is so great.</h2>
    <strong>It's so simple, yet so profound.</strong>
    <p>Websites these days try so had to keep your attention. Isn't a more simplified, practical approach just better?</p>
    <p> I mean just look at <a href="https://ca01000875.schoolwires.net/Domain/396">this example</a>.</p>
    <strong> an <em>embarrassment</em> for sure.</strong>
    <h2>Here's a list of other websites worse than this one.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://youtube.com">Youtube</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://ebay.com">Ebay</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections">NYT's Connections Game</a></li>
    </ul>
    <strong>And for those wondering, here's the quality ranking of those websites based on the opinions of the creator of this site.</strong>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections">NYT's Connections Game</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://youtube.com">Youtube</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://ebay.com">Ebay</a></li>
    </ol>
    <p>When compared to this website, these websites should evoke feelings of disappointment.</p>

    <p>If that image seemed unnecessarily large, it's because I was trying to prove a point.</p>
