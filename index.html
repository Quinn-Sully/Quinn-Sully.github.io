    <h1>The best website by Quinn Sullivan</h1>
    <h2>This website is simply the best website.</h2>
    <h2>I'll tell you why now.</h2>
    <strong>Firstly, look at that URL.</strong>
    <p>You couldn't convince me that that isn't the greatest URL ever.</p>
    <p>I mean look at it, a hyphen before the first period? And it isn't even a .com? Wow.</p>
    <h2>But that isn't all, here are even more reasons as to why this website is so great.</h2>
    <strong>It's so simple, yet so profound.</strong>
    <p>Websites these days try so had to keep your attention. Isn't a more simplified, practical approach just better?</p>
    <p> I mean just look at <a href="https://ca01000875.schoolwires.net/Domain/396">this example</a>.</p>
    <strong> an embarrassment for sure.</strong>
