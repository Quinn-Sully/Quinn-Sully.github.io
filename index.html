    <h1>The best website by Quinn Sullivan</h1>
    <strong>This website is simply the best website.</strong>
    <p>I'll tell you why now</p>
    <strong>Firstly, look at that URL</strong>
    <p>You couldn't convince me that that isn't the greatest header ever.</p>
    <p>I mean look at it, a hyphen before the first period? And it isn't even a .com? Wow.</p>
