            <h2>Ideals Intro</h2>
            <h3>(Sep 14, 2021)</h3>
            <p>The first official Redwood TV episode released by D’Angelo’s team, this episode simply lays out D’Angelo’s 
                goal of finding the ideal way of doing the cultural things we love. Through the 4:3 aspect ratio and the 
                dated filters, the Ideals Intro segment positioned D’Angelo as RTV’s loose cannon of the 2021-2022 school 
                year. </p>

            <h2>Ideals: Music</h2>
            <h3>(Sep 28, 2021)</h3>
            <p>At an unusually long 2 minutes and 50 seconds, Ideals’ Music segment was the first full length segment of the 
                D’Angelo team’s Redwood TV career. It was the first episode that included Quinn Sullivan as the editor, who 
                was still learning how to properly edit video. In fact, the segment’s background music contained only that of 
                Kevin Macleod, a classic non-copyrighted internet artist.</p>

            <h3>(Oct 12, 2021)</h3>
            <p>Using what they learned from their first full-length episode, the D’Angelo team managed to make what many would 
                describe as an all-around better segment for their second ever. Fitting comfortably into the broader episode’s 
                timeline at just over two minutes, they even managed to please the executive producers of that year, something 
                they’d be inconsistent at in later years to say the least.</p>

            <h2>Ideals: RTV Segment</h2>
            <h3>(Jan 11, 2022)</h3>
            <p>Clocking in at three and a half minutes, Ideals’ final episode serves as a microcosm of future D’Angelo segments 
                to come. Including a fake comic interview with Quentin Tarantino, a descent into madness in front of a conspiracy 
                board, and a self-reflective epiphany, this finale may not have been the most comprehensible to the average 
                half-interested Redwood TV viewer, but it was certainly the D’Angelo team’s crown jewel at the time.</p>

            <h2>Ideas: Nihilism</h2>
            <h3>(Feb 7, 2022)</h3>
            <p>Continuing the philosophical trend from Ideals’ finale, Ideas’ first segment contains by far the most 
                D’Angelo-to-camera talking time of any segment released previously. It didn’t aim to impress the audience with 
                ambitious editing, either, but went for a simpler looking approach that was equally as complicated. For instance, 
                when the last drop of water drops from D’Angelo’s faucet about halfway through, the droplet actually slows down 
                in the middle of its fall. Though the D’Angelo segment has crazier episodes both behind and ahead of it, the 
                Nihilism segment can go to show the amount of thought and time D’Angelo’s team put behind script writing and 
                editing.</p>

            <h2>Ideas: Egoism</h2>
            <h3>(Mar 1, 2022)</h3>
            <p>In Ideas: Egoism, D’Angelo explores how living one’s healthiest lifestyle on paper may not always bring them the 
                fulfillment or happiness they need, ending on an existential note as is starting to become classic of a D’Angelo 
                segment. The segment isn’t a particularly acclaimed one relative to the other’s the D’Angelo team has put out over 
                the years, but continues to show how real lessons can be learned even from a segment synthesized by silly 
                sophomores.</p>

            <h2>Ideas: Optimism</h2>
            <h3>(Apr 18, 2022)</h3>
            <p>Ideas: Optimism manages to get across the message that we have a lot to be thankful for but takes a more deadpan 
                approach to its humor than usual. For instance, D’Angelo is inspired as he prepares an egg to eat by how an egg 
                could become a fully grown chicken. Optimism also manages to pull off a rather ambitious skit pretty smoothly, 
                when D’Angelo adds some Monster Energy to his frying egg and starts a fire.</p>

            <p>Absurdism might possibly be the most ambitious segment D’Angelo’s team has ever put out, its combination of 
                complicated effects, existentialism, bizarre skits and meta-awareness make it basically the closest we have 
                to the quintessential D’Angelo Segment episode. </p>

            <p>The finale of Ideas is one that almost makes the whole series seem meaningless, which sounds like it would be 
                a problem until one realizes that’s exactly what a segment about philosophy wants the viewer to think. D’Angelo 
                tells the audience that the segment doesn’t end there, that each audience member needs to find their own 
                philosophy in their own life, and ends by stepping outside, something he canonically hadn’t done in years 
                due to COVID.</p>

                be the last episode Gabby would feature in, as she dropped the TV and Media Production class soon after the beginning

                making the previous year, including more jokes, interesting editing techniques, and something to learn about. This 
                episode also marked the beginning of the slowdown of the D’Angelo team’s production, with this episode taking so

                off despite scientists knowing that carbon dioxide had the potential to heat up the atmosphere. Its main purpose was

            <h3>(Feb 16, 2023)</h3>
            <p>Climate’s nearly 4 minute transportation episode is the most in-depth perspective on any topic that the D’Angelo 
                team has covered thus far, but that’s in large part due to the time constraints that usually prevent episodes from 
                being much longer than 3 minutes in length. It speaks about how Marin is a car-dependant place, how while public 
                transportation is the most realistic climate-friendly option, it’s still far from reasonable to rely on, and how if 
                the US wants to put a dent in its largest carbon emission sector, it needs to make itself less car dependant and more 
                easily traversable using public transportation.</p>

                inefficiencies in the grocery industry, from the huge expanses of land required to raise animals to how 40% of 
                groceries that make it to the shelves are thrown away. It’s comparable in many ways to the previous transportation 
                segment in that it takes a relatively deep dive into the problem it aims to address and offers solutions that 
                anyone could try.</p>

                that time it features a painting competition, an interview with prominent members of the Redwood painting community, 
                a brief history on painting, and the judging of that competition.</p>

            <h2>Wicked Super Mega Awesome Art Show: Music</h2>
            <h3>(Mar 1, 2024)</h3>
            <p>The much more interview-oriented music segment of the Wicked Super Mega Awesome Art Show features members involved in 
                Redwood’s musical community and offers the audience a look into what it’s like to be part of the music department at 
                Redwood. The team was originally going to do an episode on ceramics, but the head of the art department steered them 
                towards music instead which delayed the episode until March of 2024.</p>
